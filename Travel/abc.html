I have a new laptop that has a 4K display. It's set at the recommended 250% zoom level. I also have 2 Full HD monitors plugged into it (1920x1080) each set at the recommended zoom level of 100%. The 4K display is in the middle with Full HD monitor on each side.

The issue I'm having is moving an application from the Full HD screen to the 4K display and vice versa. When using the Windows-Shift Right/Left keys to move between screens, the application usually gets resized incorrectly where it ends up being too small or too large (exceeding the screen) and I need to manually resize it. A similar problem happens if I drag an application from the 4K to the Full HD screen and vice versa. It's become a hassle to have to manually resize the applications after they are moved to a different display.

Does anyone have any tips on how to make the applications resize accurately when moving them to a different resolution/zoom level monitor? I'd consider a 3rd party application if Windows itself is unable to do it. I'm on Windows 10 Creators Update.
