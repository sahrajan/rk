    <P><b>1. Rise to the Top of the Rock:</b> Going to the top floor of the Empire State Building is what most out-of-towners flock to, but most New Yorkers will tell you to go to Top of the Rock, instead, meaning the observation deck on the 70th floor of the skyscraper at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The Empire State Building is, admittedly, taller than the Rockefeller Building, but you can't see New York City's most iconic skyscraper when you're inside of it. Going to Top of the Rock offers the same sweeping panorama with all of the city's most important sights.

                    <P>Visiting Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty is an inspiring, striking experience. As dual symbols of freedom and hope, these incredible monuments and their museums give proof to the story of immigration and recognize the human spirit of our nationâ€™s ideals.

                    </P><br><p>You'll undoubtedly be sharing the experience with crowds of other tourists, but navigating the lines and crowds is well worth it for the chance to gaze upon the modern-day colossus that is the Statue of Liberty.</p>
                    <p>A symbol of American democracyâ€”and a one-time beacon of hope and promise for immigrants arriving at U.S. shores by boat via New York Harborâ€”is indeed, still today, an inspiring sight to behold. Dating to 1886 (as a gift from France to the American people), the monumental 151-foot-high sculpture (sculpted by FrÃ©dÃ©ric Bartholdi and engineered by Gustave Eiffel) sits atop a pedestal out on Liberty Island, which guests reach via Statue Cruises ferry service from Battery Park in Downtown Manhattan.</p>

          <div class="paragraph-nepal-box">
        </P><br><p> While the statue may garner most of the glory, don't overlook a visit to the nearby attraction Ellis Island. Now a national museum of immigration, the complex once served as a federal immigration station and processing center for new arrivals to the U.S. between 1892 and 1954. Expect an altogether insightful presentation, via artifacts, photographs, and multimedia exhibits, of the immigrant experience in America. Best of all, the entry's included with your ferry fare, so plan ahead to make a day of it.</p>
